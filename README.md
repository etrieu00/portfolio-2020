### Why I choose React
After trying both Angular and React, I fell in love with the way I can create functional components. I currently work as a Java software developer. I work on a desktop application with JavaFX for the UI. I love to compare the differences between each languages and how each one decided to tackle the problem of creating a good UI. 

### Functional Programming
I belive that functional programming is the way to go. I love how everything flows. In my free time I am learning clojure and how to curry better. Ramda is a really cool library.
